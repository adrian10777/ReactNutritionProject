                        <p id="aboutp1"> Hi! my name is Adrian Henriquez, and I am passionate about helping others transition to a vegan diet to help them be their best self. Often, transitioning to a vegan diet can help you prevent or heal from many of the diseases prevalent today. You may have noticed that there is a lot of misinformation surrounding this lifestyle, or you may just not know where to even begin which can make the transitioning phase very intimidating. I know this because I made the transition myself. It was quite a bumpy road, but I have dedicated myself into finding the best way to transition successfully and preserve that success! If you are interested in becoming vegan to become your best self I make this transition, go smoothly. I canâ€™t wait to work with you. See you on the other side!</p>
